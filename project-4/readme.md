## Project 4 - Sensors

In this project, we'll see how easy it is to make use of sensor readings.

#### Key Concepts/Components

The code is a little more complex in this project, but there aren't any new concepts really. We're tracking the min and max values read from the sensor so we can appropriately map the sensor reading to the 0 (off) to 255 (fully on) scale.
